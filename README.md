# BasicDataStructuresLibrary

This is a library that implements some basic Data Structures:

-  Hash table – cchashtable.c/h 
-  Heap – ccheap.c/h 
-  Stack – ccstack.c/h 
-  Self Balancing Binary Tree – cctree.c/h 
-  Vector – ccvector.c/h 
  
  
  It also contains a test program ( test_lib ) for each data structure.
